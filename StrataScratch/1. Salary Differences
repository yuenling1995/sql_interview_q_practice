Question: 
Write a query that calculates the difference between the highest salaries found in the marketing and engineering departments. Output just the absolute difference in salaries.

Think:
There are 2 ways to approach this problem. 
First we can fetch the maximum salary in each department in 2 separate queries, and then subtract them.
Second we can use "case" statement to get the maximum salary for each department and then find its difference in one query only


Solution 1:

select 
    max(case when department = 'marketing' then salary else null end) -
    max(case when department = 'engineering' then salary else null end) as salary_difference
from db_employee emp
join db_dept dep
on emp.department_id = dep.id




Solution 2:

select(
(select max(salary) 
from db_employee emp
join db_dept dep
on emp.department_id = dep.id
where department = 'marketing')
-
(select max(salary) 
from db_employee emp
join db_dept dep
on emp.department_id = dep.id
where department = 'engineering')) as salary_difference
