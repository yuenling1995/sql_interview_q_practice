Question:
Find the last time each bike was in use. Output both the bike number and the date-timestamp of the bike's last use (i.e., the date-time the bike was returned). Order the results by bikes that were most recently used.

Think:
group by each bike number, find the maximum value in the "end_time" column as the return time


Solution:
select bike_number, max(end_time) as last_used
from dc_bikeshare_q1_2012
group by 1
